Description: The goal of mlstrOpalr is to provide functions to support 
     compatibility between Maelstrom R packages and Opal environment. 
     Opal is the OBiBa application for data management, and Opal environments 
     can be integrated with RStudio environments using the package `opalr`. 
     The user must have adequate credentials to interact with a specific Opal 
     environment.
     Please see <https://opaldoc.obiba.org/en/dev/> for complete documentation.
